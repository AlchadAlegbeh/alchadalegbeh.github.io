excerpt: '<div style="text-align: justify "> This paper analyzes how carbon risk can affect the stochastic discount factor (SDF). I found that the SDF is affected by both the green and carbon shocks of consumption. Moreover, my long-run carbon consumption model solves the equity premium, volatility, and risk-free rate puzzles by decomposing the consumption growth into two components- green consumption and carbon consumption. My model setting increases the ability of the investors to detect the long-run risk by 10%. Namely, investors can profit from it by using climate change news. Also, my long-run risk variable explains the cross-section of industries/firms. Furthermore, this paper proposes a solution to the critic of the canonical long-run risks model by showing that carbon consumption does have both long-run risks in mean and in volatility as opposed to the usual goods and services consumption measure. We find the long-run risk in the carbon consumption growth is highly persistent. This means one should encourage households to consume green which is equivalent in terms of the policy to encourage firms to produce green.</div>'

## Model
**Long-run carbon consumption risks model**
$$\Delta c_{t+1} = \Delta cc_{t+1} - \Delta\alpha_{cc, t+1}$$ 
<font color=violet>$$\Delta cc_{t+1} = \nu_{cc} + x_t + \sigma_t \epsilon_{cc, t+1}$$</font> 
$$x_{t+1} = \rho_x x_t + \psi_x \sigma_t \epsilon_{x, t+1}$$ 
$$\sigma_{t+1}^2 = (1 - \nu)\sigma^2 + \nu \sigma_t^2 + \sigma_w \epsilon_{\sigma, t+1}$$
<font color = green> $\Delta\alpha_{cc, t+1} = \nu_\alpha (1 - \rho_\alpha) + \rho_\alpha \Delta\alpha_{cc, t} + \sigma_\alpha \epsilon_{\alpha, t+1} + \pi \sigma_t \epsilon_{cc, t+1}$</font>
<p
align="center"> Finally, the dividend of any asset i growth rate is as follow : </p>
 
$$\Delta d_{i, t+1} = \nu_i + \phi_i x_t + \phi_{\alpha, i} \Delta\alpha_{cc, t} + \psi_i \sigma_t \epsilon_{i, t+1}$$$\epsilon_{x, t+1}, \epsilon_{cc, t+1}, \epsilon_{\alpha, t+1}, \epsilon_{i, t+1}$ and $\epsilon_{\sigma, t+1}$ are i.i.d.
 
 
 
## Findings
- LRCCR model replicates the equity premium, volatility and risk-free rate much better than LRR :
 - By decomposing consumption growth into two components ;
 - Long-run risks in both expected carbon consumption and volatility.
- Our LRCCR model increases the capacity to detect the long-run risk during the period 1956-2018. But during the period 1930 - 1955, it was less dectectable :
 - Investors can profit from it using climate change news ;
- The long-run risk variable <font color="blue">$x_t$</font> and its confditional variance <font color="blue">$\sigma _t ^2$</font> help improving the predictability of the equity premiuù and the consumption growth.
