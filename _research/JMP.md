title: "JMP - Long run carbon consumption risks and asset prices"

permalink: /research/JMP
excerpt: '<div style="text-align: justify "> This paper analyzes how carbon risk can affect the stochastic discount factor (SDF). I found that the SDF is affected by both the green and carbon shocks of consumption. Moreover, my long-run carbon consumption model solves the equity premium, volatility, and risk-free rate puzzles by decomposing the consumption growth into two components- green consumption and carbon consumption. My model setting increases the ability of the investors to detect the long-run risk by 10%. Namely, investors can profit from it by using climate change news. Also, my long-run risk variable explains the cross-section of industries/firms. Furthermore, this paper proposes a solution to the critic of the canonical long-run risks model by showing that carbon consumption does have both long-run risks in mean and in volatility as opposed to the usual goods and services consumption measure. We find the long-run risk in the carbon consumption growth is highly persistent. This means one should encourage households to consume green which is equivalent in terms of the policy to encourage firms to produce green.</div>'
