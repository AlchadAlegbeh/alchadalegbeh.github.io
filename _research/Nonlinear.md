excerpt: '<div style="text-align: justify "> This paper shows how truly independent nonlinear factors improve the stochastic discount factor estimation. Their main purpose is to serve as factors to predict future returns out-of-sample. We use the Fama-French 25 ME/BM- sorted portfolios and fifty anomaly portfolios adding interaction terms built using individual stock characteristics. Then, we estimate the SDF using raw characteristic return, linear principal component, and a nonlinear principal component. We found that the SDF estimated using nonlinear factors outperform the one using linear factors or raw characteristic returns in terms of OOS $R^2$ performance. The nonlinearity introduced through the nonlinear PC performs very well with respect to the nonlinearity introduced through interaction.</div>'
